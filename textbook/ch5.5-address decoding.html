<center><h1>1. ADDRESS DECODING </h1></center>
Until now we have used only a single 4K memory chip. But this may not be the case. Our design may have many memory chips instead of just one. For example, we may not be able to find a 4K chip and hence decide to use 4 1K chips; or one 2K and 2 1K chips; or 2 2K chips. These chips must be assigned an address range. Or we may decide not to use the full addtess range. We may just want to use 1K of memory, for instance. <br>

In all such cases, CPU works under the assumption that there is just one single 4K memory chip outside. It sends addresses to the outer world and have no idea which memory chip it is trying to communicate. Hence, there must be an external "intelligence" which looks at the address generated by the CPU, and deduces which memory chip is to be activated. <br>

This problem is solved in two steps:
<itemize>
</item> The first step is to assign nonoverlapping memory ranges to each memory chip. These ranges are known as a "Memory map"
</item> A circuit called "address decode logic" is created according to the memory map. This circuit activates a single memory chip every time CPU generates a memory address.
