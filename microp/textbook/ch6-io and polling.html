<h1> SIMPLE I/O DEVICE DESIGN WITH POLLING </h1>
Input: Data is read from an input device (keyboard, mouse, disk etc) into a CPU register by the CPU. 
In the next stage, CPU generally writes this data to a memory location. <br>
In more advanced computers, input devices write their data directly to memory without CPU intermediation. This is called DMA (direct memory access). <br><br>
Output: Just the reverse of input<br><br>.

<h2>How software sees I/O devices</h2>
Software sees I/O devices as a group of memory locations, ie, exactly like memory. <br>
We dont need any new instructions to do IO. Regular instructions to deal with memory (LD and ST) is all that is needed. 

<h3>Memory map</h3>
Memory space = 2 to the address bits<br>

Difference between Input, output and memory locations:<br>
Memory: Whatever CPU writes stays there untill overwritten or power out.<br>
Input: The content of this location is determined by an input device, independently of CPU. CPU can only read these locations.<br>
Output:The content of this location is written by the CPU, and this content is sent to the output device.<br>
Example memory map: <br>
The locations in the range can only be written, but may not be written. If we try to write to these locations we may receive unspecified behaviour. This is because these locations are not memory cells, and hence cannot be used for the storage of information. They are used instead to write information into the device registers. Hence, we can st, but not ld these addresses.

<h2>An example unsynchronized circuit, with a program that drives it</h2> 
The best way to learn about IO is to inspect an example first, then design your own system. Hence, without getting bogged down in theory, We will oresent a circuit that <br>
(1) read the data from a a set of 16 switches and <br>
(2) display it on a set of 16-leds and <br>
(3) goes to step (1) <br>
In this way, when we change any switch, it will immediately be reflected in leds.
<h3> Memory map of our circuit
The software will see our switch set as a single 16 bit memory location. When kth switch is closed, kth bit in this location becomes 1. If kth switch is not closed, the same kth bit is zero. Similar operations

<h3> The complete circuit </h3>
<h3>The program that drives the circuit</h3>
Note that we can write this program without designing the hardware.
<h2>Synchronization problem</h2>
Resolved with a flag register in the IO device. This register is also placed in memory.
