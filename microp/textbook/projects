Project 1:  Implement The processor designed in class with 8 registers

Project 2: Add PUSH, POP, CALL and RET instructions to the processor designed in project 1. In addition, you must have
              - A 2K memory (0-2K in memory map)
              - An 16-bit switchboard  (At 4K)
              - 2 8-bit seven segment displays (Also at 4K)
to the board. 

You should reflect all changes in the switchboard immediately to 7-segment displays.

Note that 7-segment displays are actually 8-segments (ie, the additional dot).

project 3: Logisim simple switch.
