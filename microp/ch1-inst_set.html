  <p>The processor we will develop has the following properties</p>
  <div class="padding2">
    <h2>1.1 Basic Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>16 Bit data bus</li>
      <li>12 bit address bus. Processor can address 4K of memory.</li>
      <li>4 general purpose registers (GPR's). Will be expanded to 8 later.</li>
      <li>4 special purpose registers: Program Counter (PC), Address
        Register (AR), Instruction Register (IR), FLAGS register. Stack
        pointer (SP) and stack-related operations (PUSH, POP, CALL,
        RET) will be added later.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Two addressing modes will be used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Register indirect</strong>: Uses the contents of a general purpose
        register as a pointer to a memory location(used by load/store
        instructions)
      </li>
      <li><strong>PC relative:</strong> Adds the offset contained in the instruction
        to the contents of PC to obtain a pointer to a memory location
        (used by jump instructions)
      </li>

    <p>Later on, we will add the instructions PUSH, POP, CALL
      and RET to this list. Note that all these instructions require a
      stack, and therefore we have to implement a stack and a SP
      register before implementing them.

  <h2>1.4 Instruction Formats</h2>

  <div class="padding3">
    <h3>1.4.1 Format of the <code>LD</code> / <code>ST</code> instructions</h3>
    <p>In assembly language, these instructions are written as <code>LD X Y</code>
      where X and Y are numbers between 0 and 3. </p>
    <p><code>LD X Y</code> will : </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the memory location whose address is contained in register Y</li>
      <li>Transfer the contents of that memory location into register X.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The instruction <code>ST X Y</code> does just the reverse, ie </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the memory location whose address is contained in register X</li>
      <li>Transfer the contents of register Y to that memory location.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A useful aid to memory is: Recall that in C/C++ assignments
      the data always travels from right to left, ie, in <code>count = x</code>, the
      value of the variable x is transferred to the variable count.
      Similarly, in <code>LD</code> and <code>ST</code> operations, the register that determine
      the source is always at the right and the the register that
      determine the destination is always at the left.</p>
    <p>The machine code for these instructions are 16-bits long and
      has the following format:</p>
    <div class="row "><img src="assets/LD_ST_instructions.jpg" class="center-block"/></div>

    <p> d in the figure means "don't care", as usual. In our examples
      we will always fill don't care locations with 0's (and never
      with 1's) for consistency, even though this does not matter in
      practice.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong>To illustrate the passage from
      assembly language to machine code, we give some assembly language
      <code>LD</code> / <code>ST</code>instructions on the left and their machine code
      translations in hexadecimal on the right:</p>

    <p>Note that the same register can be both source and
      destination. <code>LDI 2 2</code> will load into register 2 the data whose
      address is in register 2.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="padding3">
    <h3>1.4.2 Format of the LDI instructions</h3>
    <p>The assembly language format for the LDI instruction is
    <code>LDI R X</code>. R denotes one of the general purpose registers, therefore it
      is a number between 0 and 3. X is the 16-bit immediate data that
      is to be loaded to this register. It can be in one of the three
      different formats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If x is a string, it denotes the address of a variable or a
        label. If it denotes the address of a variable, there should be a
        corresponding declaration on the <code>.data</code> section (<code>.data</code> section
        will be explained later), where the string X must be
        declared. For example, if we use <code>LDI 2 COUNT</code>, and if COUNT is
        a variable, then, in the <code>.data</code> section, we must have some
        declaration like <code>COUNT: 5</code>, where 5 is the initial value of
        the variable count. <code>LDI 2  COUNT</code> will not load 5 into reg2,
        but the address of the memory location where 5 is
        stored.<br>
        On the other hand, if we have <code>LDI 2 LOOP</code>, and if LOOP is a
        label, there must be some instruction in the program labeled
        with LOOP, and the address corresponding to this label will
        be loaded into register 2.<br>
        Note that in assembly language both LOOP or COUNT are
        strings, while in machine code they must be 16-bit (in case
        of variable) or 12-bit (in case of label) numbers. The
        conversion between strings and numbers is done by the
        assembler.
      </li>
      <li><code>LDI 2 40</code> will load the decimal value of 40 into reg2</li>
      <li><code>LDI 2 0x40</code> will load hexadecimal value of 40 into reg2.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The machine code format of LDI instruction is as :</p>

      instructions are given on the left and their machine code

  <div class="padding3">
    <h3>1.4.3 Format of the JZ/JMP instructions</h3>

    <p>The assembly language format for JZ/JMP instructions are <code>JMP X</code> and
      <code>JZ X</code> where x is a string which is a label in the program (More on
      labels later). So, if we use the instruction<code>JMP LOOP</code>then LOOP must
      be defined as a label somewhere in the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The machine code formats of <code>JMP</code> / <code>JZ</code> instructions are as follows:
    </p>
    <div class="row "><img src="assets/JMP_JZ_instructions.jpg" class="center-block"/></div>
    <p>
      Note that in assembly language X is a string, while in machine
      code x is an 12 bit number. The conversion between these two
      forms is done by the assembler, according to the formula (address
      of the label)-(address of JUMP/JZ instruction)+1. The operation
      is done in twos complement notation, and if the label occurs
      before the JUMP/JZ instruction, we get a negative result.</p>

      ALU CODE must be at least 4 bits wide
